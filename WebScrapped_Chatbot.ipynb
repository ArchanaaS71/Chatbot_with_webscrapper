            "As the third largest municipal utility in California, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) provides three essential utility services: water, wastewater and electric power. Millions of people throughout the City and County of San Francisco rely on the SFPUC to mitigate negative impacts on the environment while providing clean drinking water, effective wastewater disposal, and reliable electricity.\n",
            "To consistently deliver vital wastewater services, SFPUC adopted advanced IoT technology to help meet challenges that include environmental compliance, climate variability, and aging infrastructure networks. With a focus on real-time data gathering, automated alerts, and comprehensive modeling, SFPUC decided to incorporate the Trimble Telog enterprise solution to help protect the environment and maintain the critical infrastructure used by its growing customer base.\n",
            "As a primary environmental concern, the SFPUC wastewater system collects, conveys, and provides secondary treatment to combined sewage flows—stormwater and sewage—within the City and County of San Francisco before discharging it into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. SFPUC’s combined sewer system consists of 1,010 miles of pipes, a wet weather transport/storage system and three treatment plants taking in flows from roof drains, domestic sewage and street runoff.\n",
            "Data gathering is accomplished through a wide assortment of sensors and wireless recorders, including a rain gauge network, combined sewer discharge (CSD) level monitoring, flow model calibration, and saltwater intrusion detection. The SFPUC monitoring network encompasses more than 120 Trimble Telog® battery-operated, data recording telemetry units (RTUs) that transmit data wirelessly into Telog Enterprise software. Telog Enterprise stores and analyzes data, provides alerts and alarming, and integrates with third-party distributed control systems and application software. Access to the information is available via the web and mobile applications for iPhones, iPads and Android devices.\n",
            "“The Trimble Telog enterprise solution provides benefits such as fast deployment, open architecture, rapid scalability and minimal engineering, plus a lower total cost of ownership in contrast to traditional SCADA technologies,” explains Anton Loof, senior application engineer for Ponton Industries, a Trimble solutions provider in flow, level, temperature, pressure, and process control requirements.\n",
            "SFPUC’s alarm-based messaging powered by the Trimble Telog technology, activates when rain or flow has exceeded a critical threshold, assists in the decision-making process and tracks correlation between multiple data sets or trends in real time, supporting environmental compliance and reporting. Other benefits include early warning from collection system events to plant operations, pre-development monitoring for upgrades and forensic analysis of wet-weather and storm effects.\n",
            "By incorporating the Trimble Telog solution, SFPUC has access to data that supports operational decision-making in real-time, prioritizes repairs and rehabilitation, and develops calibrated models. The solutions provide increased knowledge of the entire wastewater system with the ability to do forensic analysis, such as pipe flow reversal during wet weather events, ultimately improving SFPUC’s ability to prepare for and handle adverse situations.\n",

            "Vegetation risk to overhead power lines is a perennial issue for electric utility networks. A sudden electric flashover can ignite encroaching vegetation or a tree-fall can result in electrical faults, sustained outages and wildfires. These issues cause expensive damage and repairs, decrease network reliability and impact a provider’s ability to ensure a sustainable energy source.\n",
            "Standard approaches for vegetation management use LiDAR data to identify which trees are close to the network and provide a static snapshot of the state of vegetation threats. While this technique provides some value, it doesn’t identify growth patterns or prioritize tree-fall risk—two factors that are paramount for maintaining consistent distribution networks.\n",
            "As an electricity provider to 2.4 million people, Australia’s Endeavor Energy has been challenged to cost-effectively assess and predict vegetation risks to its distribution assets and deliver reliable energy to its customers across New South Wales (NSW). The company wanted to implement a smart and efficient vegetation management solution that would help them foresee vulnerabilities, prioritize identified risks and develop a targeted, risk-based management approach. Most importantly, it needed a system that would lower vegetation maintenance costs without reducing their exposure to risk.\n",
            "Those needs led Endeavor to test the Vegetation Analytics solution from Trimble’s NM Group, which specializes in providing technology solutions for the energy industry.\n",
            "A wide-scale trial, the project focused on 12,000 kilometers of the company’s NSW network based in a high bushfire-risk area. For the most effective historical analysis, Endeavour and NM Group collated and prepared three years’ worth of geospatial data, including cutting records, hazard tree records and modeling Endeavor’s unique calculation of risk criteria. Teams also mapped more than 3,500 fallen trees to build the statistical models needed to predict the likelihood of tree-fall risk.\n",
            "Field teams also surveyed more than 43 sites and measured and inspected 400 trees to calculate biological and structural variables for use in the modeling.\n",
            "Using Vegetation Analytics’ data integration and diagnostic tools, the NM Group’s team were able to inventory trees, model growth patterns per span and risk-rank trees based on their match to local fall patterns. Quantitative testing of this tree-fall model on historical tree failure indicated an 80 percent success rate in the model’s prediction ability.\n",
            "With the comprehensive data analysis, Endeavour could also clearly identify which spans should be pruned versus cut. Being better informed enables them to reduce contractor costs through more targeted work assignments.\n",
            "The foresight also enables Endeavour to be proactive, prioritize vegetation management programs, and optimize costs.\n",
            "“Having well-organized and high-quality data is a key input to this type of project which uses powerful data analytics, cloud processing and machine learning techniques to optimize our vegetation maintenance program,” said Vegetation Control Manager, Endeavor Energy.\n",
            "Based on the project’s success, Endeavour is branching out to a more cost-effective, risk-based approach to vegetation management. Firmly rooted in using Vegetation Analytics, the company is driving toward its goal of reducing its management operating costs by 40 percent.\n",

            "\n",
            "Despite coral reef’s rich contributions to people and marine life, scientists estimate that the Caribbean has lost 60 percent of its healthy coral in the past three decades. The challenge to help conserve the region’s reefs has been due in part to the lack of a complete map of the reefs’ topography, their habitat communities and different coral types. Without the big picture of a comprehensive map of the basin’s entire ecosystem, it’s been difficult to dive under the surface to better understand the coral world, monitor it and develop protective strategies.\n",
            "The Caribbean Division of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has been focused on monitoring, protecting and restoring the region’s marine environments for more than 40 years. As the plight of coral reefs has become more urgent, so too have TNC’s efforts to tackle coral conservation—and meet the demands for better maps.\n",
            "“Reef maps are an essential tool for coral resource managers, but historically these maps have had insufficient detail, been outdated or been produced for small areas,” said Dr. Steve Schill, TNC’s lead scientist and marine conservation specialist in the Caribbean Division. “Not having access to accurate, large-area reef maps has limited our understanding of these ecosystems and the benefits they provide.”\n",
            "Having used Trimble’s eCognition® object-based image analysis (OBIA) software for automatically classifying and mapping small reef areas, Schill believed eCognition could be the enabling, scalable approach to map the hundreds of thousands of reefs across the region.\n",
            "To begin, Schill worked with technical professionals at Earth observation company Planet and researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) to select more than 30,000 4-meter-resolution scenes from the Dove satellite constellation. The team then created a seamless mosaic of the whole Caribbean basin. He also partnered with eCognition specialists Tama Group to develop the OBIA method to automatically classify benthic habitats.\n",
            "To map reefs, Tama Group experts integrated the Dove satellite surface reflectance and Dove-derived bathymetry into eCognition. The software first delineates land and sea areas deeper than 15 meters. Based on depth data and known topographic characteristics, it then categorizes the overall reef structure, distinguishing reef crest, fore reef, back reef, patch and fringing reef. Once it defines the five reef classes, eCognition determines seagrass classes (dense and sparse), sand types, dredged areas, and then finishes with mapping the deeper hard bottom algae classes. In total, the software automatically classifies 13 different benthic habitats.\n",
            "Using this workflow, eCognition successfully classified the shallow water benthic habitats of the entire Caribbean Basin in four months—an area about the size of Texas and California combined. The software exported each classified area as vector shapefiles and Schill and his team downloaded them for analysis and quality control.\n",
            "With each classification, Schill’s team has been assessing the data to map the benthic habitats. Moving from reef to reef, they’ve been using field data to methodically analyze the accuracy of the classifications, and making manual corrections where needed.\n",
            "To date, a full suite of benthic habitat maps at a 4-meter resolution have been produced for 23 countries and territories across the insular Caribbean. These maps can be viewed and downloaded at http://caribbeanmarinemaps.tnc.org and will eventually be made available later in 2021 on the Allen Coral Atlas’ online atlas https://allencoralatlas.org/.\n",

            "But the company also recognized that planners have knowledge about certain drivers and customers, beyond the data that appears in a Transportation Management System (TMS), and they didn’t want to lose that knowledge.\n",
            "Paper Transport began searching for a dispatch solution that could recommend matches, while allowing planners to make final choices based on their relationships with drivers and customers. The solution was Trimble Dispatch Advisor.\n",
            "Paper Transport was already using Trimble’s TMW Suite solution and modules including Asset Maintenance and Data Warehouse so Trimble Dispatch Advisor was an easy addition.\n",
            "Trimble Dispatch Advisor reviews available driver-customer matches based on variables like location, driver Hours of Service (HOS) and time windows. The system then makes a recommendation for a match and the reasons behind the recommendation as well as backup matches. Planners make the final decision.\n",
            "“Our planners were very willing to transition to Trimble Dispatch Advisor, since it supports the heavy lifting of matching,” Decker says.\n",
            "Beyond streamlining the scheduling process, Trimble Dispatch Advisor also has reduced empty miles. “Our biggest win has been lowering the fleet’s deadhead percentage,” Decker says. “That’s a big expense for an over-the-road carrier. Our planners are excited about reducing that metric.”\n",
            "After using Trimble Dispatch Advisor for just a few months—and despite market fluctuations due to COVID-19—the company reports a 2 percent decrease in empty miles, with goals for future reductions.\n",
            "That’s a big win for planners and drivers alike, Decker says.\n",

            "As the third largest municipal utility in California, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) provides three essential utility services: water, wastewater and electric power. Millions of people throughout the City and County of San Francisco rely on the SFPUC to mitigate negative impacts on the environment while providing clean drinking water, effective wastewater disposal, and reliable electricity.\n",
            "To consistently deliver vital wastewater services, SFPUC adopted advanced IoT technology to help meet challenges that include environmental compliance, climate variability, and aging infrastructure networks. With a focus on real-time data gathering, automated alerts, and comprehensive modeling, SFPUC decided to incorporate the Trimble Telog enterprise solution to help protect the environment and maintain the critical infrastructure used by its growing customer base.\n",
            "As a primary environmental concern, the SFPUC wastewater system collects, conveys, and provides secondary treatment to combined sewage flows—stormwater and sewage—within the City and County of San Francisco before discharging it into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. SFPUC’s combined sewer system consists of 1,010 miles of pipes, a wet weather transport/storage system and three treatment plants taking in flows from roof drains, domestic sewage and street runoff.\n",
            "Data gathering is accomplished through a wide assortment of sensors and wireless recorders, including a rain gauge network, combined sewer discharge (CSD) level monitoring, flow model calibration, and saltwater intrusion detection. The SFPUC monitoring network encompasses more than 120 Trimble Telog® battery-operated, data recording telemetry units (RTUs) that transmit data wirelessly into Telog Enterprise software. Telog Enterprise stores and analyzes data, provides alerts and alarming, and integrates with third-party distributed control systems and application software. Access to the information is available via the web and mobile applications for iPhones, iPads and Android devices.\n",
            "“The Trimble Telog enterprise solution provides benefits such as fast deployment, open architecture, rapid scalability and minimal engineering, plus a lower total cost of ownership in contrast to traditional SCADA technologies,” explains Anton Loof, senior application engineer for Ponton Industries, a Trimble solutions provider in flow, level, temperature, pressure, and process control requirements.\n",
            "SFPUC’s alarm-based messaging powered by the Trimble Telog technology, activates when rain or flow has exceeded a critical threshold, assists in the decision-making process and tracks correlation between multiple data sets or trends in real time, supporting environmental compliance and reporting. Other benefits include early warning from collection system events to plant operations, pre-development monitoring for upgrades and forensic analysis of wet-weather and storm effects.\n",
            "By incorporating the Trimble Telog solution, SFPUC has access to data that supports operational decision-making in real-time, prioritizes repairs and rehabilitation, and develops calibrated models. The solutions provide increased knowledge of the entire wastewater system with the ability to do forensic analysis, such as pipe flow reversal during wet weather events, ultimately improving SFPUC’s ability to prepare for and handle adverse situations.\n",

            "Vegetation risk to overhead power lines is a perennial issue for electric utility networks. A sudden electric flashover can ignite encroaching vegetation or a tree-fall can result in electrical faults, sustained outages and wildfires. These issues cause expensive damage and repairs, decrease network reliability and impact a provider’s ability to ensure a sustainable energy source.\n",
            "Standard approaches for vegetation management use LiDAR data to identify which trees are close to the network and provide a static snapshot of the state of vegetation threats. While this technique provides some value, it doesn’t identify growth patterns or prioritize tree-fall risk—two factors that are paramount for maintaining consistent distribution networks.\n",
            "As an electricity provider to 2.4 million people, Australia’s Endeavor Energy has been challenged to cost-effectively assess and predict vegetation risks to its distribution assets and deliver reliable energy to its customers across New South Wales (NSW). The company wanted to implement a smart and efficient vegetation management solution that would help them foresee vulnerabilities, prioritize identified risks and develop a targeted, risk-based management approach. Most importantly, it needed a system that would lower vegetation maintenance costs without reducing their exposure to risk.\n",
            "Those needs led Endeavor to test the Vegetation Analytics solution from Trimble’s NM Group, which specializes in providing technology solutions for the energy industry.\n",
            "A wide-scale trial, the project focused on 12,000 kilometers of the company’s NSW network based in a high bushfire-risk area. For the most effective historical analysis, Endeavour and NM Group collated and prepared three years’ worth of geospatial data, including cutting records, hazard tree records and modeling Endeavor’s unique calculation of risk criteria. Teams also mapped more than 3,500 fallen trees to build the statistical models needed to predict the likelihood of tree-fall risk.\n",
            "Field teams also surveyed more than 43 sites and measured and inspected 400 trees to calculate biological and structural variables for use in the modeling.\n",
            "Using Vegetation Analytics’ data integration and diagnostic tools, the NM Group’s team were able to inventory trees, model growth patterns per span and risk-rank trees based on their match to local fall patterns. Quantitative testing of this tree-fall model on historical tree failure indicated an 80 percent success rate in the model’s prediction ability.\n",
            "With the comprehensive data analysis, Endeavour could also clearly identify which spans should be pruned versus cut. Being better informed enables them to reduce contractor costs through more targeted work assignments.\n",
            "The foresight also enables Endeavour to be proactive, prioritize vegetation management programs, and optimize costs.\n",
            "“Having well-organized and high-quality data is a key input to this type of project which uses powerful data analytics, cloud processing and machine learning techniques to optimize our vegetation maintenance program,” said Vegetation Control Manager, Endeavor Energy.\n",
            "Based on the project’s success, Endeavour is branching out to a more cost-effective, risk-based approach to vegetation management. Firmly rooted in using Vegetation Analytics, the company is driving toward its goal of reducing its management operating costs by 40 percent.\n",

            "In construction, calculating building materials, site development and labor are standard costs considered for every project. But in the last few years, a new cost layer has been included with more frequency: embodied carbon emissions and impacts.\n",
            "In Europe and parts of North America corporate and public sector building owners are seeking to manage embodied carbon––the carbon footprint of a building or infrastructure project before it becomes operational––to meet net-zero carbon targets. And they’ve begun using new automated and life cycle assessment tools from Trimble and One Click LCA to help shape and inform their structural design and development.\n",
            "Integrating Trimble’s Tekla tools with One Click LCA’s database of construction materials’ carbon levels gives structural engineers an automated embodied carbon and life cycle assessment solution for all stages of a project. Together, designers can combine carbon data with structural design to instantly understand the embodied carbon impacts of their structural and materials choices for new and existing structures.\n",
            "\"I’ve been waiting for a solution like this for as long as I've been in the industry,\" said Kari Nöjd, Sustainability Technology Manager at engineering firm Sweco Rakennetekniikka Oy, Europe’s leading architecture and engineering consultancy based in Stockholm. “Instead of focusing only on cost and schedule, more building owners are asking which alternative has the lowest embodied carbon, and that is something structural designers need to be able to answer.”\n",
            "Historically, Sweco’s process for calculating environmental impacts was manually calculating carbon quantity estimations of building elements from drawings or building information models (BIMs), and then transferring the data into the One Click software. It was not only a time consuming exercise, it was vulnerable to calculation errors when design changes were made.\n",
            "An ambitious project to build a new $30-million carbon neutral sports center in Imatra, Finland, however, presented an opportunity to pilot a new connected, concept and design workflow using Tekla and One Click LCA.\n",
            "With Tekla Structural Designer designers can examine various concepts and materials such as concrete, wood or a hybrid of materials and automatically analyze these choices with One Click LCA’s carbon calculator, eliminating the need to manually calculate carbon footprints for every design concept. The live carbon calculations and the added insight offered into the performance of the building help inform better and greener decisions.\n",
            "“Integrating the design software with the database is about 10 times faster, which allows people to do carbon analysis more often, earlier and on more projects,\" said Panu Pasanen, CEO of One Click LCA, based in Helsinki.\n",
            "By integrating the two tools, designers can also easily compare life cycle carbon footprints of different designs and can also specify comparison parameters such as only load-bearing structures, providing a more dynamic, detailed and accurate design environment to create constructible BIM models.\n",
            "“Thanks to the integration of Tekla and One Click, we can now easily create diagrams with numerical values to compare the lifecycle carbon footprints of different design options,” said Ossi Kujala, a structural designer with Sweco. “We can also add building elements manually to One Click after we have imported the Tekla model.”\n",
            "In addition, teams can use the live link between One Click and Tekla Structures, Trimble’s constructible BIM software, enabling users to view and generate highly accurate carbon reports based on the detailed model.\n",
            "With its design nearing completion, the Imatra sports hall will be among Finland's first structures aiming to reach carbon neutrality. And as Finnish legislation due by 2025 will require owners of new buildings and most major renovations to demonstrate compliance with mandated carbon footprint limits, embedding sustainable design into the earliest conceptual phases will help engineers determine the best built environment for a building’s entire lifecycle.\n",

            "Given its experience in serving a vast array of markets, Yodel’s record growth and demand for its services was increasing pressure on Yodel’s fleet. Customers were expecting orders to be fulfilled quickly, and many had specific timeframes for when they’re available to receive deliveries, so they needed accurate ETAs. Wanting to maintain the same standard of service it had built its success with, Yodel sought out tools that would help it reduce the time spent in depots by drivers and improve productivity, all while maintaining great customer service.\n",
            "As a company committed to innovation, Yodel partnered with Trimble Maps to integrate new routing technology into Yodel’s proprietary driver application.\n",
            "With the goal to provide critical information directly to drivers via iPhone or Android devices, Trimble Maps’ technical teams collaborated with Yodel to ensure their application objectives were successfully deployed. Now, when parcels are assigned and loaded into each Yodel driver’s app according to their region and start time, the software instantly generates an optimized stop order, accounting for predefined priority destinations, expected delivery time per stop, historical travel times etc. to create an accurate ETA for each stop along the way. Trimble Maps’ routing solution allows drivers to quickly identify if a route is over or underloaded, so routes can be load balanced prior to finalizing. Once the driver approves and finalizes the route, the technology generates an accurate ETA for each stop, which allows Yodel to communicate a two-hour delivery window to customers receiving a parcel through Yodel’s Xpect service.\n",
            "“Technology that enables drivers to optimize stops in seconds helps Yodel’s full-time and lifestyle drivers improve productivity while improving customer service,” said Chris Quin, EMEA VP at Trimble Maps. “Putting advanced technology in drivers’ hands to automate route sequencing and ETAs helps drivers focus on exceeding customer expectations.”\n",
            "Integrating Trimble Maps technology into the Yodel Driver app has given drivers an average of 20 extra minutes each day through better route optimization, increasing driver productivity, saving fuel, and reducing carbon emissions. At the same time, the technology has allowed Yodel to communicate accurate delivery time windows to Xpect service customers 98.77 percent of the time, improving customer satisfaction.\n",
            "Through Trimble Maps’ technology, Yodel is meeting rising demand efficiently while maintaining its focus on customer service.

            "The MX50 is typically mounted on a car or truck and driven at highway speeds to capture data for asset management, mapping, and road maintenance projects. Portcoast found that the operations on the boat delivered the same 360-degree color imagery and precise point cloud and met the desired accuracy of less than 1 to 2 centimeters. The small waves on the river had negligible effect on operations; in just 15 minutes the riverbank and river-facing infrastructure were scanned. Trimble Business Center field-to-finish survey software and Applanix POSPac® Mobile Mapping Suite were used to process the MX50 data.\n",

            "Ireland’s forest industry is poised for significant growth over the next 10 years. The country’s forest cover is about 11 percent, or 770,000 hectares, leaving sizeable space for expansion. It boasts the fastest growth rates in Europe, thanks to its temperate climate and tree species planted. And it has the largest importer of wood in Europe––the United Kingdom––on its doorstep.\n",
            "Along with these opportunities, however, comes the challenge to manage the forest effectively, protecting the climate change resource from theft, identifying important areas for nature and people and delivering quality wood products to market. As the largest forest manager in Ireland, Coillte has been living this challenge every day. Through technology, Coillte has been planting innovative solutions to help the company manage its forests effectively and sustainably.\n",
            "Coillte, a semi-state forest company with headquarters in Newtownmountkennedy County Wicklow, manages 440,000 hectares of lands––nearly 7 percent of the total land area of Ireland––and dedicates 20 percent of its holdings primarily for biodiversity. With a vision to manage the State forests on behalf of the people of Ireland and to deliver the multiple benefits from its forests, Coillte has put technology, security and sustainability at its core. One key development is the launch of its Smart Timber Security System (STSS) designed to innovate its supply chain to connect people and its forests in real time, ensuring the right information and the right products are delivered to the right person every time.\n",
            "Upgraded in 2021, the STSS combines the WSX targeted forest logistics tool from Trimble Forestry with a telematics solution from ORBCOMM. Designed to meet Coillte’s sustainable stock management needs as well as the needs of its customers, the customized haulage, logistics and telematics (HLT) solution enables Coillte to better manage all branches of its supply chain––from customer orders, planning, harvesting, loading, transporting and delivery. Most importantly, the satellite-based system connects Coillte and 400 haulage trucks in real time, enabling the company to manage its log supply and distribution with improved visibility, flexibility, control, interactivity and security.\n",
            "Once supply chain coordinators collaborate with the harvesting function and the Galway-based Trimble Forestry team to generate timber orders, hauliers use the WSX mobile app to download their electronic timber removal permit (TRP) which details the precise job order––logs to collect, amount to collect, and from which forest. When the driver arrives at the designated section of geofenced forest, an alert is sent to the WSX, prompting the tool to confirm if the driver is in the right place. Validated, the driver proceeds to loading where they can ensure they’re collecting the exact species, length and volume of logs ordered. The driver then proceeds to delivery. The WSX system is monitoring this forest floor-to-mill activity in real time, ensuring that harvesters know what and how much is moving from their lots, hauliers know they have fulfilled the order, and sawmills know what and how much is en route to their mill. With more confidence in the haulage process and optimized navigation, drivers can reduce rework, fuel use and their carbon footprint.\n",
            "With 95 percent of Ireland’s timber haulage vehicles equipped with this integrated system, the solution’s detailed monitoring not only delivers real-time insight into Coillte’s forest inventory it also provides effective timber traceability and the platform to comply with the country’s plant health regulations––functionality they did not have before.\n",
            "“With this system, we know precisely where any log was cut, its type, who hauled it and where it was delivered, which directly complies with the plant health passport system requirements,” said Des Phelan, Coillte’s distribution manager. “And should any driver be stopped by a forest service inspector, they can generate that passport data in the cab. That’s just one of the many benefits we get from a technology driven supply chain system that improves our efficiency, traceability, stock management and sustainability.”\n",
            "The forest to customer traceability that the WSX system provides also gives Coillte a proactive capability to protect trees from harmful pests and disease. Because it can trace its inventory down to the individual tree species, the company has the accurate knowledge to identify any forest areas that are vulnerable and the responsiveness to rapidly close off specific sections if an outbreak occurs.\n",
            "Ensuring Coillte’s forest products are continuously available from thousands of different harvesting sites requires complex and layered management. Having technology allows Trimble’s support team to see the trees and the forest and can help ensure Ireland’s sustainable resource will endure for generations to come.\n",

The goal of the act is to cut direct and indirect funding of groups engaged in armed conflict and human rights abuses.\n",

Tracing these materials back to their country of origin is a complex task that may require us to, among other things, survey suppliers in our supply chain to understand what programs they have in place for tracing the source of minerals supplied to us or used in products supplied to us and to ensure that reasonable due diligence has been performed. Trimble uses and encourages its suppliers to use the OECD Due diligence Framework as part of the due diligence process to determine the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals in the assemblies, parts or components they supply to us.\n",

            "Sweden’s transport infrastructure is bursting at the seams. Its roads and railways are clogged and an estimated 16 percent population growth by 2040 is forecast to bring about a 30 percent increase in passenger transport. In addition, the movement of goods is expected to grow by 50 percent, further straining its aged infrastructure. Bearing the initial brunt of this high volume will be the railways.\n",
            "To meet this demand as well as climate objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045, the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) committed to building the country’s first-ever high-speed railway (HSR). Connecting Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö, the 440-kilometer dual-rail network will support trains at speeds of 250-320 kilometers per hour, cutting by half today’s journey times between Stockholm and Malmö and increasing sustainable travel and freeing more space for freight transport on the existing railway.\n",
            "Choosing where to place the new tracks and stations is the job of Atkins Sweden, a global design and engineering consultancy that is a recognized leader in sustainable business practices.\n",
            "Since 2019, it has been conducting a feasibility study for the East Link Project (ELP), the first 160-km section of the HSR that runs from Järna, south of Stockholm to Linköping. Atkins’ role is to develop design alternatives for track routes and station locations in Linköping based on a host of factors such as safety, geometry, costs, and environmental impacts.\n",
            "Historically, feasibility studies required teams to pore over maps and both manually draw potential alignments and calculate costs. For the ELP, Atkins streamlined that process through the expertise of Mark Lidback, a railway designer, and one piece of software—Trimble® Quantm™, an alignment planning solution that integrates engineering, environmental, social and economic factors into a simultaneous analysis of alternatives.\n",
            "“Quantm not only automates the laborious and costly manual feasibility process, it provides a more in-depth analysis with high precision in a fraction of the time,” said Lidback. “I can input my start and end points, along with factors to consider such as cost and geometric parameters, protected nature areas, military zones, and CO2 emissions, and it will automatically generate optimal alignments, corridors and estimated costs. I can then compare and test the different scenarios to determine the best option. It’s a totally different game.”\n",
            "A significant challenge for Atkins is designing an optimal connection from one station to the next.  Where the station is placed In Linköping will influence different exit and entrance routes to the next station. All the possible entrance/exit points need to be assessed for each station and equally compared. With Quantm, Lidback can quickly determine possible corridors and line alignments, identify if those options will require bridges or tunnels, and calculate construction costs. He can also quickly change any analysis parameters and run new tests and comparisons—a valuable advantage given the fluidity of the project scope and tight deadlines.\n",
            "“I’ve generated about 250 different scenarios for the project so far,” said Lidback. “And the corridors I’ve produced are also optimized based on that CO2 factor. There’s no way I could’ve produced that magnitude of analysis myself without Quantm.”\n",
            "As the STA speeds toward the end of its design consultation phase in 2022, Atkins will be on board to help them determine the most favorable and sustainable route from point A to B.\n",

            "Farmers have always been challenged to combine traditional agronomic techniques with the best precision technology and plant science to grow their crops—and farms—organically and sustainably.\n",
            "UK-based PX Farms is one agribusiness using precision agriculture and geospatial solutions. Run by fourth-generation farmer James Peck, PX Farms has been farming its 4,850 hectares (12,000 acres) since it was established in 2003—a business that grew from the Pecks family-owned businesses dating back to 1896.\n",
            "Capitalizing on its own successes with advanced farm-management technologies, the company provides agricultural services and tailored solutions to help establish, operate, grow and improve farm businesses.\n",
            "“Millions of people depend on what we do, so it’s crucial that we take care of the environment,” said Peck. “We use the latest technology and innovative farming techniques to maximize yields, reduce input costs and minimize environmental impacts.”\n",
            "Innovation is indeed at the company’s core. PX Farms was one of the first in the UK to use Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF), an agriculture approach that involves using the same vehicle tracks consistently across all machinery. With CTF they’ve reduced soil compaction and damage to their land by 73 percent, overall fuel costs by 13 percent, and input expenses by 6 percent.\n",
            "Supporting this system are hardware and software solutions from Trimble that connect Peck’s fields and farm specialists and give them the tools to turn farm data into profitable decisions in real time.\n",
            "With Trimble® Ag Software (formerly FarmWorks), PX Farms can integrate, simplify, and streamline disparate data streams to manage its entire farm operation with a few clicks. Most importantly, they have the tools to capture and integrate important operational data and analyze it to get the most value from every hectare.\n",
            "To maximize yield and reduce fuel cost, every single field is mapped with Trimble RTK technology and set up for machines with a 11.9 meter axel width and a 1.8 meter internal track spacing, ensuring exact wheel placement. Connected to guidance and mapping features of the Trimble FmX precision agriculture display, Peck can ensure the machinery operates within a tolerance of 2 centimeters.\n",
            "The Trimble FmX® and TMX™ systems also automate crop spraying. Peck can map nutrients per hectare and program the data into the spreader to meet that year’s offtake. He can also minimize phosphate amounts being sprayed while maximizing the phosphates each plant gets.\n",
            "PX Farms’ is reducing inputs by 3-5 percent and decreasing pollution with its precision drill and sprayer. Using RTK positioning for sectional control, they can target the right amount of product to the right place in their field. Utilizing a boom spreader also allows the company to improve distribution accuracy and make the most of fertilizer as a critical crop input. Coupled with the certainty and precision provided by Trimble technology, and its sustainable farming practices, PX Farms is reaping the rewards of what it sows.\n",

Cada pedido aceito será interpretado como um único conjunto de Termos, independentemente dos outros pedidos. 1.         Definições. \"Produtos\" significa os produtos de hardware fornecidos no presente instrumento. \"Software\" significa qualquer software, biblioteca, utilitário, ferramenta ou outro código de computador ou programa, na forma de objeto (binário) ou código-fonte, e a documentação relacionada fornecidos pela Trimble a você. O Software inclui o firmware de Produtos, programas instalados localmente nos seus sistemas e programas que você acessa via Internet ou outros meios remotos (tais como sites, portais, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) e soluções “baseadas na nuvem”). \"Serviços\" significa quaisquer serviços prestados pela Trimble, conforme descritos em um ou mais Contratos de Serviço. \"Contratos de Serviço\" são contratos de serviço, tais como de suporte e manutenção ou serviços profissionais, \"Descritivo dos Serviços\", e qualquer outro documento similar mutuamente acordado. Estes Termos não se aplicam aos Contratos de Serviço que têm os seus próprios termos e condições.2.         Disposições gerais.2.1       Cotações, Validade dos pedidos: Nossas cotações são não vinculantes, a menos que expressamente estipuladas por escrito. Os pedidos são aceitos como válidos e vinculantes somente quando confirmados por nós por escrito. Os pedidos não podem ser cancelados por nenhum motivo sem o nosso consentimento prévio por escrito.2.2       Termos de Pedidos Básicos: Todos os pedidos devem incluir as seguintes informações: (i) os Produtos e Software encomendados e quantidades, (ii) o(s) número(s) de peça(s) da Trimble, (iii) preços, e (iv) instruções de entrega, (coletivamente, \"Termos de Pedidos Básicos\"). Todos os Termos de Pedidos B\u0000ásicos são fixos e finais mediante a aceitação do pedido.2.3       Licença de software. Todo o Software é licenciado ou fornecido como um serviço e não é vendido. O Software está sujeito a contratos separados fornecidos pela Trimble em conexão com o Software, incluindo, mas não se limitando a quaisquer licenças de software, manuais de produtos, manuais de operação ou outros documentos (como um Contrato de Licença de Usuário Final (“EULA”), Termos de Uso ou Termos de Serviço) (coletivamente, “Contratos de Usuário”). Você concorda que será regido por estes Contratos de Usuário. Se houver um conflito ou inconsistência entre estes Termos e os de um Contrato de Usuário, os termos do Contrato de Usuário prevalecerão. Se um Contrato de Usuário ou outros termos de licença não acompanharem o Software incluído com um Produto ou Serviço, então Trimble concede a você um direito pessoal, não exclusivo, revogável e não transferível de acessar e utilizar o Software apenas conforme necessário para você desfrutar do benefício do Produto ou Serviço. Nada nestes Termos deverá ser interpretado como concedendo quaisquer direitos ou licença para utilizar qualquer Software de qualquer maneira ou para qualquer fim que não seja expressamente permitido pelo Contrato de Usuário aplicável.3.         Entrega.3.1       Tempo para entrega: Os prazos de entrega são estabelecidos quando a Trimble aceita o pedido por escrito. Envidaremos todos os esforços comercialmente razoáveis para atender as suas datas de entrega solicitadas, a menos que você esteja inadimplente com base nestes Termos ou o cumprimento seja de outra forma dispensado. Nós não somos responsáveis por entrega atrasada ou adiada. O atraso na entrega não constitui uma justificativa para você cancelar nenhum pedido.3.2       Prazos de Entrega: A propriedade e risco de perda ou dano a Produtos são transferidos a você quando entregamos os produtos para a transportadora (\"Entrega\"). Salvo acordo em contrário, vamos entregar o frete do Produto pré-pago, desde que você nos pague ou reembolse todos os custos de transporte, frete, seguro (se aplicável), impostos, taxas e outras despesas de envio relacionadas aplicáveis. Nós temos o direito de fazer entregas parciais. O Software pode ser entregue eletronicamente, a critério da Trimble. A propriedade do Software continuará sendo da Trimble ou de seus licenciadores.4.         Aceitação, inspeção, Aviso de não conformidade:4.1       A aceitação dos Produtos encomendados é considerada como tendo ocorrido mediante a nossa Entrega dos Produtos à transportadora. A sua aceitação de Software encomendado é considerada como tendo ocorrido quando o Software é ativado ou de outra forma disponibilizado para o seu acesso ou utilização, o que ocorrer primeiro. Você é responsável por avisar prontamente um dano identificado ou não conformidade dos Produtos. Você deve inspecionar a condição da embalagem e os Produtos no recebimento, e indicar qualquer dano evidente à transportadora na nota de entrega, fazendo o agente da transportadora assinar o documento e, no prazo de 2 (dois) dias após o recebimento dos Produtos danificados ou não conformes, enviar todos os documentos por e-mail ou fax para as nossas instalações a partir de onde o envio ocorreu, em conjunto com as referências da transportadora. Reivindicações de danos nos Produtos “ocultados” devem ser feitas por você à transportadora diretamente, e você também deve nos fornecer notificação por escrito e uma cópia desta reclamação no prazo de 10 dias contados a partir do recebimento dos Produtos afetados. Da mesma forma, você deve nos notificar no prazo de até 10 dias do recebimento dos Produtos incorretos. Se você ficar com o Produto sem nos avisar no período de aviso designado, será considerado como tendo renunciado ao seu direito de recusar o Produto.4.2       Se você cancelar um pedido de Produto aceito no prazo de 10 dias antes da remessa ou recusar Produtos conformes recebidos no âmbito de um pedido aceito, temos o direito de exigir uma indenização razoável para reabastecer o nosso estoque e outras despesas efetivamente incorridas.5.         Devolução do Produto: Todas as devoluções de Produtos estão sujeitas a autorização prévia por escrito e devem cumprir os nossos procedimentos de devolução de produtos (RMA) em vigor.

Antes de devolver ou trocar um Produto, você deve entrar em contato conosco diretamente para obter um número de autorização para incluir com a sua devolução. Você deve devolver os Produtos para nós na sua embalagem original ou equivalente, e é responsável pelo risco de perda e pelas despesas de envio de volta para a Trimble. Os Produtos recebidos, mas não elegíveis para devolução, serão enviados de volta para você com o frete por sua conta. Para devoluções aprovadas, você receberá crédito equivalente ao preço da fatura do produto ou o seu valor de substituição atual, o que for menor, deduzido de quaisquer encargos ou taxas aplicáveis.6.         Preços, condições de pagamento, impostos:6.1       A não ser que indicado de outra forma por escrito, o pagamento integral deverá ser realizado dentro de 30 dias da data de emissão da nossa fatura.

Mediante solicitação, você vai cooperar conosco para aprimorar qualquer direito de garantia desta natureza.6,5       Você é responsável por quaisquer custos incorridos por nós caso alterar ou cancelar qualquer pedido, e por todos os custos de cobrança de valores vencidos (incluindo honorários advocatícios).6,6    \u0000   Os nossos preços estabelecidos para Produtos e Software não incluem os impostos sobre vendas, Imposto sobre Valor Agregado, taxas de exportação ou importação, taxas de transporte ou seguro, taxas e encargos aduaneiros, impostos sobre propriedade pessoal ou encargos similares aplicáveis, sendo que você é responsável por pagar todos eles.

This PO is Buyer’s offer to the person, firm or company identified on the face of this PO (“Seller”) upon these PO terms and conditions (the “Terms”) and is not an acceptance by Buyer of any offer to sell. Seller will be deemed to have accepted this PO and assented to all of its Terms upon the earlier of Seller’s written acceptance of the PO or Seller’s commencement of performance. This PO expressly limits acceptance to its Terms. If a separate written purchase agreement exists between Seller and Buyer regarding the Items covered by this PO, the terms of such agreement will prevail over any inconsistent Terms in this PO.\n",
            "1. Definitions. In addition to the definitions above which are incorporated by reference into this Section 1, “Item(s)” means the goods and/or services to be furnished by Seller to Buyer as set forth on the face of this PO. “Blanket PO” means a PO that defines all specifics of a purchase except the quantity and delivery dates, which are later communicated in writing by Buyer to Seller. “Release” means Buyer’s PO authorizing Seller to ship a definite quantity of Items scheduled for delivery on a specified date. “Estimated Usage” or “Forecasted Quantity” means the quantity of Items for which Buyer reasonably expects to issue Releases under its PO.\n",

            "2.2 If Seller decreases prices for its products and services that are comparable in quantity, form and function to the Items sold to Buyer under this PO, Seller shall adjust the price of all such unshipped or unperformed Items to the lower prices.\n",
            "3. Invoicing and Payment 3.1 Seller may submit invoices to Buyer’s Accounts Payable Department at the address on the front of this PO no earlier than upon shipment or completion of services.  Invoices must specify the PO number, order line Item number (if any), part number, description, quantity, unit price, date of shipment, and such other information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer from time to time.\n",
            "3.2 Unless otherwise specified in this PO, payment will be net forty-five (45) days from date of invoice, provided that Buyer receives Seller’s correct and valid invoice, and further provided that the Items have been delivered or performed in accordance with this PO and Buyer has accepted them.  Buyer is entitled at all times to set-off any amount (e.g., price or cost adjustments) owing from Seller to Buyer or any of its affiliates against any amount payable at any time by Buyer under this PO.\n",
            "4. Forecasts, Releases and Scheduling 4.1 If this PO constitutes a Blanket PO, any Item quantities designated as Estimated Usage or Forecasted Quantity are provided for Seller’s planning purposes only and are not binding purchase commitments. Only Releases represent Buyer’s obligation to purchase under the Blanket PO. If this PO constitutes a Blanket PO with scheduled Releases, Seller shall acknowledge each Release promptly in writing to Buyer.\n",
            "4.2 Upon 15 days written notice to Seller, Buyer may reschedule any Release in whole or in part at no additional charge.

            "5. Cancellation/Termination for Convenience.  Buyer may, by notice, terminate this PO in whole or in part at any time and for any reason.  No charge will be imposed for cancellation of orders for Seller standard Items not unique to Buyer.  Buyer’s sole liability for cancellation of orders for Items unique to Buyer’s design and/or specification (“non-standard Items”) will be as follows:  Any claim for order cancellation charges for non-standard Items must be submitted in writing by Seller to Buyer’s purchasing officer associated with this PO within 30 days following receipt of Buyer's notice. Seller’s claim may include (i) the cost of unique work in process, (ii) the cost of paying claims to Seller's vendors for work in process and materials directly allocable to Items cancelled and which cannot be delivered to other customers of Seller or returned to Seller's vendors.  Seller shall wherever possible place such work in process or materials in inventory and sell it to, or use it for, other customers.  In no event will such claim or Buyer’s liability exceed the total purchase price that Buyer would have paid under this PO for the Items cancelled.  Upon payment of Seller's claim Buyer will be entitled to receive all work and materials paid for.  Buyer reserves the right to inspect Seller's work in process and to audit all relevant documents prior to paying Seller's claim.\n",
            "6. Cancellation/Termination for Default. If Seller fails to deliver Items on time, to replace or correct non-conforming Items, or to perform any other obligations under this PO, Buyer may by written notice of default and without liability to Buyer: (i) cancel this PO, in whole or in part, and Seller shall be liable to Buyer for all damages, losses and liability incurred by Buyer directly or indirectly resulting from Seller’s default, or (ii) obtain the Items ordered under this PO from another source with any resulting excess cost chargeable to Seller, if such default is not cured by Seller within 10 days of Buyer’s notice. Buyer further reserves the right, by written notice of default and without liability to Buyer, to cancel and terminate this PO in whole or in part without liability to Buyer for any of the following; (i) the institution of insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings against Seller; (ii) Seller's making an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iii) Seller's dissolution, liquidation or ceasing to do business in the normal course.\n",
            "7. Effect of Cancellation/Termination. Upon any notice of cancellation or termination of this PO, Seller shall immediately discontinue work and cease placing of orders for materials for that portion of the PO cancelled or terminated, but shall continue to supply any portion of this PO not cancelled or terminated and any other outstanding POs or contracts between Buyer and Seller. Upon cancellation or termination of this PO (in whole or in part) for any reason, at Buyer's request Seller shall transfer title and deliver to Buyer any completed Items, and any partially completed Items and all unique materials.

Security Breaches. In case of any suspected or actual security breach affecting your Developer Applications, End User Data, the Trimble Toolkit, or the Trimble Solution, you must immediately notify Trimble (via https://incidents.trimble.com/cyber-security or a successor website) and cooperate with Trimble to remediate the issue and mitigate its effects. You must obtain Trimble’s approval for any security breach notifications to End Users, notifications to government entities (unless such notices are required by law), and press releases, in each case that refer directly or indirectly to Trimble. F. Trimble Solution End User Terms. Use of the Trimble Solution requires each End User to enter into Trimble Solution End User Terms. You will not facilitate or encourage any End User to violate the Trimble Solution End User Terms. If Trimble receives any data from your Developer Applications on an End User’s behalf, that data will be subject solely to the Trimble Solution End User Terms with the applicable End User, and such data will no longer be subject to your Developer Application Terms with the End User.G. Fees you Charge. You may not directly or indirectly charge end users of a Developer Application for use of, or access to, the functionality of the Trimble Toolkit. If you charge any fees for your Developer Applications, you are solely responsible for collecting those fees independently from Trimble.

Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have full power and authority to enter into and perform in accordance with the Terms and to exploit your Developer Applications without violating any other agreement; (ii) your access to and use of the Trimble Toolkit and your Developer Applications and their use will not violate any Laws or third party rights (including intellectual property rights and rights of privacy or publicity), and you will notify Trimble if your Developer Applications become subject to any claim or complaint regarding violation of Laws or third party rights; (iii) you will not to engage in any deceptive, misleading, illegal, or unethical practices that may be detrimental to Trimble, the Trimble Toolkit, the Trimble Solution, or End Users; and (iv) all information you provide to Trimble is and will be true, accurate, and complete (and you will keep such information up-to-date). You agree not to (A) suggest any affiliation with Trimble (including that Trimble sponsors, endorses, or guarantees your Developer Applications) except for the relationship expressly contemplated in the Terms, and (B) make any representations, warranties, or commitments on Trimble’s behalf or regarding the Trimble Toolkit or Trimble Solution.I. Indemnification. You will indemnify, defend (at Trimble’s request), and hold harmless Trimble and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, end users, and licensees from and against any claims, losses, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), damages, or liabilities based on or arising from: (i) actions taken through your Developer account or login credentials; (ii) your Developer Applications; (iii) your relationships or interactions with any user (including End Users) or third parties in connection with your Developer Applications; (iv) loss of your code, content, data, or contributions removed by Trimble in connection with the termination of your account; or (v) your breach or alleged breach of the Terms. Trimble may at its own expense participate in the defense and settlement of any claim with its own counsel, and you may not settle a claim without Trimble’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).J. Attribution. You will comply with all attribution requirements, if any, set forth in the Documentation, the Supplemental Developer Terms, or otherwise provided by Trimble.\n",
            "Listings. This Section 8 applies only if you submit your Developer Application for listing on a Trimble Directory. A. Listing Approval. Listing your Developer Application on a Trimble Directory requires Trimble’s approval. To apply for approval, you must provide Trimble with your Developer Application and any Listing Materials requested by Trimble. Trimble may approve or reject adding any Developer Application to a Trimble Directory in its sole discretion. You remain solely responsible for your Developer Application despite any Trimble approval.B. Trimble Rights. If Trimble approves your submitted Developer Application, you grant Trimble and its affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide license to:i. List your Developer Application in the Trimble Directory;ii. Use, host, copy, and distribute your Developer Application to enable interoperability with the Trimble Solution; and iii. Use, distribute, and publicly perform and display your Listing Materials and Developer’s Marks to market and promote your Developer Application. This includes rights to modify and create derivative works of your Listing Materials.\n",
            "Trimble retains sole discretion and control over the placement, look, and feel of any Trimble Directory. Trimble may sublicense its license rights to its affiliates, agents, contractors, and marketing and channel partners. Trimble does not guarantee any End Users will discover or enable your Developer Application. C. Developer Application Terms. You are responsible for your Developer Application Terms and how you present them to users and obtain their agreement. Your Developer Application Terms must be consistent with your rights and obligations in the Terms (including regarding End User Data and any termination, suspension, or take-down of your Developer Application). Trimble is not a party to your Developer Application Terms and is not responsible for how End Users use your Developer Application or for enforcing your Developer Application Terms.D. Take-Downs. You may request that Trimble remove your Developer Application and related Listing Materials at any time via https://developer.trimble.com or a successor url. Trimble will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly remove your Developer Application and Listing Materials following receipt of your request. In addition to its other rights, Trimble may temporarily or permanently take-down any Developer Application listed in the Trimble Directory in its discretion, without notice to you. Following any take-down pursuant to this Section 8(d), Section 12(d) (Wind-Down) will apply with respect to the removed Developer Application.9. Trimble Support; Changes to Trimble Toolkit. Unless otherwise specified by Trimble in writing in the Documentation or Supplemental Developer Terms, Trimble has no obligation to provide any maintenance or support for the Trimble Toolkit or your Developer Applications, or to fix any errors or defects. From time to time, Trimble may change the Trimble Toolkit and future versions of the Trimble Toolkit may not be compatible with your Developer Applications built using previous versions. Trimble typically makes these changes as part of its overall developer program and is unable to provide notice of the changes to developers individually. Trimble will have no liability resulting from these changes. 10. Compliance. Trimble may (but is not required to) monitor your access or use of the Trimble Toolkit and how your Developer Application interacts with the Trimble Solution, including to ensure your compliance with the Terms. You will cooperate with any reasonable inquiries of Trimble, and, upon request, provide Trimble with proof of compliance.11. Ownership. Neither party grants the other any rights or licenses not expressly set out in the Terms. You retain your rights in your Developer Application, Listing Materials, and Developer’s Marks (including goodwill associated with your Developer’s Marks), except to the extent incorporating any Trimble technology or intellectual property. Trimble and its licensors retain all ownership and other rights (including intellectual property rights) in the Trimble Toolkit, Developer Portal, Trimble Marks (including goodwill associated with the Trimble Marks), Trimble Directory, and Trimble Solution. You are welcome to share with Trimble suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, or other feedback regarding the Trimble Solution, Trimble Toolkit, and Trimble (collectively, “Feedback”), and may post contributions through the Developer Portal or community features. If you provide Trimble with Feedback or post contributions, you grant to Trimble and its affiliates a royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual non-exclusive license to use Feedback and contributions for any purpose without restriction or obligation, and Trimble is not obligated to keep any such Feedback or contributions confidential (even if you tell Trimble they are confidential).   12. Term; Termination and Suspension.\n",
            "A. Term.  Unless otherwise set forth by Trimble in writing, the Terms will remain in effect for 12 months, and thereafter, will automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless either party elects not to renew by giving written notice to the other at least 30 days prior to the then-current term. B. Termination By Developer. Subject to Section 12(d) (Wind-Down), you may terminate the Terms at any time by ceasing all access and use of the Trimble Toolkit and requesting removal of your Developer Applications and Listing Materials from the Trimble Directory.C. Termination or Suspension By Trimble. Trimble may terminate or suspend the Terms or your access to or use of the Trimble Toolkit (in whole or in part): (i) for no reason or any reason upon seven (7) days’ notice to you (provided that if you paid a fee to access or use a Trimble Toolkit, Trimble also provides a pro rata refund of such fees for the remainder of the term) and (ii) immediately (A) if you breach any provision of the Terms, (B) if Trimble is required to do so by Laws, (C) in case of any security breach or other concern under Section 7(e) (Security Breaches), or (D) if Trimble otherwise determines in its discretion that such action is necessary to avoid harm, liability, or reputational damage to Trimble, the Trimble Toolkit, the Trimble Solution, or any End User. For clarity, suspension or termination may include disabling your Developer Applications. D. Wind-Down. Following any termination of the Terms or removal of a Developer Application from the Trimble Directory, at Trimble’s request (i) the parties will cooperate to effectuate an orderly wind-down and (ii) you will continue to provide your Developer Applications in accordance with the Terms for up to 90 days for the benefit of currently deployed End Users. E. Effect of Termination. Upon any termination, subject to Section 12(d) (Wind-Down): (i) your rights to access and use the Trimble Toolkit, Documentation, and Trimble Marks will immediately terminate and you will cease all such access and use, (ii) Trimble may remove all Developer Applications from the Trimble Directory, (iii) you will return or destroy all copies of the Trimble Toolkit, the Documentation, and all Confidential Information, and (iv) Sections 7 (Your Responsibilities), 11 (Ownership) through 24 (Definitions) will survive. After termination, you acknowledge and agree that you will have no further access to any data or content that you submitted to Trimble under the Terms. Termination of the Terms shall not limit or release you from any liability incurred prior to the effective date of such termination F. No Obligation or Liability. Trimble will have no obligation or liability resulting from termination, suspension, or take-down as contemplated in Section 8(d) (Take-Downs) or this Section 12 (Term; Termination and Suspension). 13. Disclaimer of Warranties. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TRIMBLE TOOLKIT, DOCUMENTATION, DEVELOPER PORTAL, AND ANY FEATURES OF THE FOREGOING (“TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING”) IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND TRIMBLE AND ITS THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. TRIMBLE MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE RELATED TO AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, PERFORMANCE, OR QUALITY OF THE TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING, THAT TRIMBLE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER ANY ELEMENT OF THE TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING, OR THAT ACCESS TO OR USE OF ANY TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR MEET DEVELOPER’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, ACHIEVE INTENDED RESULTS, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ALL SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, SYSTEMS OR SERVICES, OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED. You may have other statutory rights, in which case the disclaimers above will apply to the full extent permitted by law.14. Limitations of Liability. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TRIMBLE  OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS (A) FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY IN ADVANCE, OR (B) IN ANY EVENT, FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES EXCEEDING THE GREATER OF ONE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ($1,000) OR THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO TRIMBLE UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, TRIMBLE HAS NO WARRANTY, INDEMNIFICATION, OR OTHER OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR DEVELOPER APPLICATIONS OR THEIR COMBINATION, INTERACTION, OR USE WITH ANY ELEMENT OF THE TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING, END USER DATA, OR TRIMBLE SOLUTION. You acknowledge and agree that this Section 14 (Limitation of Liability) reflects a reasonable allocation of risk and will apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and that Trimble would not enter into the Terms without these liability limitations. This Section 14 (Limitation of Liability) will survive notwithstanding any limited remedy’s failure of essential purpose.15. Trimble Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any non-public elements of the Trimble Toolkit, Documentation, and any other information disclosed by Trimble that is marked as confidential or proprietary or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential or proprietary from the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public; (b) was known to you before its disclosure by Trimble; or (c) is received by you from a third party, in each case without breach of an obligation owed to Trimble or anyone else. You will (i) maintain Confidential Information in confidence (using at least the same measures as for your own confidential information, and no less than reasonable care) and not divulge it to any third party and (ii) only use Confidential Information to fulfill your obligations under the Terms. If you are compelled by Law to disclose Confidential Information, you must provide Trimble with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance if Trimble wishes to contest the disclosure. If you breach or threaten to breach this Section 15 (Trimble Confidential Information), it could cause substantial harm for which damages are inadequate and Trimble will have the right to seek injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.16. Independent Development; Information You Provide Not Confidential. Trimble develops a variety of products and services and works with many other developers and partners, and either Trimble or these third parties could in the future develop (or already have developed) products, services, concepts, or features similar to your Developer Application. Nothing limits Trimble’s right to do so, though this Section itself does not grant Trimble any license under your intellectual property rights. Unless separately set forth in another agreement, Trimble has no confidentiality obligations for information you submit to Trimble.17. Usage Data. In addition to Trimble’s other rights, Trimble may collect certain data and information regarding your access to or use of the Trimble Toolkit and Developer Portal, including data about your data pulls or requests, your Developer Applications, and the End User accounts that you access (collectively, “Usage Data”). We may use and exploit Usage Data for any purpose in connection with operating, improving, and supporting the Trimble Toolkit and the operation of our business.18. Open Source Software. Certain code in the Trimble Toolkit may be licensed under or include components subject to “open source” software terms (“OSS”), as listed in the Documentation, Supplemental Developer Terms, or as otherwise made available by Trimble upon request. The OSS licenses may grant you additional rights to the OSS code itself and allow you to use the OSS outside of our Trimble Toolkit. To be clear, though, when you use the OSS as part of the Trimble Toolkit, you must comply with the Terms. 19. Changes to Terms. Trimble may modify the Terms from time to time. Trimble will use reasonable efforts to notify you of modifications as provided in Section 20 (Notices). You may be required to click through the modified Terms to show your acceptance and in any event your continued access or use of the Trimble Toolkit after the notification of modification constitutes your acceptance to the modifications. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, your sole remedy is to terminate your access and use of the Trimble Toolkit as described in Section 12 (Term; Termination and Suspension). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if you have entered into a mutually executed agreement with Trimble, then any amendments require the written consent of both parties, and (B) if you have paid a fee and have electronically accepted the Terms, then the new Terms will take effect upon renewal; provided, however, in any instance of (A) or (B), for any modifications required for compliance with Laws, such modifications will take effect 30 days after they are provided to you. 20. Notices. Except as set out in these Term, any notice or consent under the Terms must be in writing and will be deemed given: (a) upon receipt if by personal delivery, (b) upon receipt if by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested), or (c) one day after dispatch if by an internationally reputable commercial overnight delivery service. If to Trimble, notice must be provided to the address in Section 22(a)(Trimble Entity) below, with a copy to Trimble Inc., Attn: General Counsel – Important Notice, 935 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA. If to Developer, Trimble may provide notice to the address Developer provided at registration, at execution of a written agreement, or otherwise in writing. Either party may update its address with notice to the other party. Trimble may also send general and operational notices to Developer by email or through the Developer Portal.21. Export Restrictions. Developer acknowledges that the Trimble Toolkit is subject to export restrictions by the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Developer will not, and will not allow any third party to, remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of Trimble Toolkit or any direct product thereof: (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, Laws of any United States or foreign agency or authority. Developer warrants that it is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. The Trimble Toolkit is further restricted from being used for the design or development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology, or for terrorist activity, without the prior permission of the United States government. Developer will defend, indemnify, and hold Trimble harmless against any liability (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of Developer’s failure to comply with the terms of this provision. Developer’s obligations under this paragraph will survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.22. Trimble Entity; Governing Law and Venue. A. Trimble Entity.

Governing Law; Exclusive Venue. The Terms will be governed exclusively by, and construed and enforced exclusively in accordance with, the laws of the jurisdiction set forth in the table above as the Governing Law based on Developer’s location provided to Trimble without regard to or application of conflicts of law provisions and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

General. The Terms are the parties’ entire agreement and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements relating to its subject matter. The Terms are a separate agreement from, and do not amend or modify, the Trimble Solution End User Terms. Except as set forth in Section 19 (Changes to Terms), all amendments or modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties. The words “including” and similar terms are to be construed without limitation. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver and all waivers must be in writing. If any provision is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so the rest of the Terms remain in effect. Developer may not assign, transfer, or delegate any right or obligations under the Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, and any non-permitted assignment is void. Trimble may assign the Terms and its rights and obligations to any of its affiliates or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities to which the Terms relate. The parties are independent contractors and the Terms do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Trimble may engage the services of subcontractors or agents in connection making the Trimble Toolkit available to you. Trimble will not be liable to Developer for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Terms if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that are beyond its reasonable control. The Trimble Toolkit and Trimble Solution are commercial computer software. If the user or licensee of such technology is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of such technology, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by the Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Trimble Toolkit and Trimble Solution were developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. If the parties enter into an executed written agreement, such agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be considered an original and all of which when taken together will constitute a single fully-signed original.  Facsimile and other electronic means of signatures are binding. The official language of the Terms is English.  For purposes of interpretation, or in the event of a conflict between English and versions of the Terms in any other language, the English language version shall be controlling.24. Australia-Specific Terms. For Developer who are located in Australia, the following provisions apply:A. “Australian Consumer Law” means the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and “Non-excludable Condition” means certain consumer guarantees, warranties, rights, or remedies under the Australian Consumer Law that cannot be limited, excluded, restricted, or modified, and to which Developer may be entitled. For purposes of the following limitation of liability statement, the parties intend for the following: “service” means a Trimble Solution that is a cloud-based offering and “goods” means Trimble Toolkit and a Trimble Solution that is a software application. B. To the extent permitted by law, Trimble’s liability in relation to breach of any such Non-excludable Condition shall be limited as follows (and in which “our” or “us” means Trimble, and “you” means Developer):\n",
            "a) in the case of the goods, to repairing or replacing the goods, supplying equivalent goods, or paying the costs of repairing or replacing the goods or acquiring equivalent goods; and\n",
            "b) in the case of the services, to re-supplying the services or paying the cost of re-supplying the services.C. Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any condition, warranty, right, or remedy implied or imposed by any statute or regulation which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted or modified.D. Nothing in these Terms is intended to derogate from Trimble’s obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) as amended from time to time.  25. Definitions.\n",

            "In construction, calculating building materials, site development and labor are standard costs considered for every project. But in the last few years, a new cost layer has been included with more frequency: embodied carbon emissions and impacts.\n",
            "In Europe and parts of North America corporate and public sector building owners are seeking to manage embodied carbon––the carbon footprint of a building or infrastructure project before it becomes operational––to meet net-zero carbon targets. And they’ve begun using new automated and life cycle assessment tools from Trimble and One Click LCA to help shape and inform their structural design and development.\n",
            "Integrating Trimble’s Tekla tools with One Click LCA’s database of construction materials’ carbon levels gives structural engineers an automated embodied carbon and life cycle assessment solution for all stages of a project. Together, designers can combine carbon data with structural design to instantly understand the embodied carbon impacts of their structural and materials choices for new and existing structures.\n",
            "\"I’ve been waiting for a solution like this for as long as I've been in the industry,\" said Kari Nöjd, Sustainability Technology Manager at engineering firm Sweco Rakennetekniikka Oy, Europe’s leading architecture and engineering consultancy based in Stockholm. “Instead of focusing only on cost and schedule, more building owners are asking which alternative has the lowest embodied carbon, and that is something structural designers need to be able to answer.”\n",
            "Historically, Sweco’s process for calculating environmental impacts was manually calculating carbon quantity estimations of building elements from drawings or building information models (BIMs), and then transferring the data into the One Click software. It was not only a time consuming exercise, it was vulnerable to calculation errors when design changes were made.\n",
            "An ambitious project to build a new $30-million carbon neutral sports center in Imatra, Finland, however, presented an opportunity to pilot a new connected, concept and design workflow using Tekla and One Click LCA.\n",
            "With Tekla Structural Designer designers can examine various concepts and materials such as concrete, wood or a hybrid of materials and automatically analyze these choices with One Click LCA’s carbon calculator, eliminating the need to manually calculate carbon footprints for every design concept. The live carbon calculations and the added insight offered into the performance of the building help inform better and greener decisions.\n",
            "“Integrating the design software with the database is about 10 times faster, which allows people to do carbon analysis more often, earlier and on more projects,\" said Panu Pasanen, CEO of One Click LCA, based in Helsinki.\n",
            "By integrating the two tools, designers can also easily compare life cycle carbon footprints of different designs and can also specify comparison parameters such as only load-bearing structures, providing a more dynamic, detailed and accurate design environment to create constructible BIM models.\n",
            "“Thanks to the integration of Tekla and One Click, we can now easily create diagrams with numerical values to compare the lifecycle carbon footprints of different design options,” said Ossi Kujala, a structural designer with Sweco. “We can also add building elements manually to One Click after we have imported the Tekla model.”\n",
            "In addition, teams can use the live link between One Click and Tekla Structures, Trimble’s constructible BIM software, enabling users to view and generate highly accurate carbon reports based on the detailed model.\n",
            "With its design nearing completion, the Imatra sports hall will be among Finland's first structures aiming to reach carbon neutrality. And as Finnish legislation due by 2025 will require owners of new buildings and most major renovations to demonstrate compliance with mandated carbon footprint limits, embedding sustainable design into the earliest conceptual phases will help engineers determine the best built environment for a building’s entire lifecycle.\n",

Customers were expecting orders to be fulfilled quickly, and many had specific timeframes for when they’re available to receive deliveries, so they needed accurate ETAs. Wanting to maintain the same standard of service it had built its success with, Yodel sought out tools that would help it reduce the time spent in depots by drivers and improve productivity, all while maintaining great customer service.\n",
            "As a company committed to innovation, Yodel partnered with Trimble Maps to integrate new routing technology into Yodel’s proprietary driver application.\n",
            "With the goal to provide critical information directly to drivers via iPhone or Android devices, Trimble Maps’ technical teams collaborated with Yodel to ensure their application objectives were successfully deployed. Now, when parcels are assigned and loaded into each Yodel driver’s app according to their region and start time, the software instantly generates an optimized stop order, accounting for predefined priority destinations, expected delivery time per stop, historical travel times etc. to create an accurate ETA for each stop along the way. Trimble Maps’ routing solution allows drivers to quickly identify if a route is over or underloaded, so routes can be load balanced prior to finalizing. Once the driver approves and finalizes the route, the technology generates an accurate ETA for each stop, which allows Yodel to communicate a two-hour delivery window to customers receiving a parcel through Yodel’s Xpect service.\n",
            "“Technology that enables drivers to optimize stops in seconds helps Yodel’s full-time and lifestyle drivers improve productivity while improving customer service,” said Chris Quin, EMEA VP at Trimble Maps. “Putting advanced technology in drivers’ hands to automate route sequencing and ETAs helps drivers focus on exceeding customer expectations.”\n",
            "Integrating Trimble Maps technology into the Yodel Driver app has given drivers an average of 20 extra minutes each day through better route optimization, increasing driver productivity, saving fuel, and reducing carbon emissions. At the same time, the technology has allowed Yodel to communicate accurate delivery time windows to Xpect service customers 98.77 percent of the time, improving customer satisfaction.\n",
            "Through Trimble Maps’ technology, Yodel is meeting rising demand efficiently while maintaining its focus on customer service.

            "The MX50 is typically mounted on a car or truck and driven at highway speeds to capture data for asset management, mapping, and road maintenance projects. Portcoast found that the operations on the boat delivered the same 360-degree color imagery and precise point cloud and met the desired accuracy of less than 1 to 2 centimeters. The small waves on the river had negligible effect on operations; in just 15 minutes the riverbank and river-facing infrastructure were scanned.

            "Ireland’s forest industry is poised for significant growth over the next 10 years. The country’s forest cover is about 11 percent, or 770,000 hectares, leaving sizeable space for expansion. It boasts the fastest growth rates in Europe, thanks to its temperate climate and tree species planted. And it has the largest importer of wood in Europe––the United Kingdom––on its doorstep.\n",
            "Along with these opportunities, however, comes the challenge to manage the forest effectively, protecting the climate change resource from theft, identifying important areas for nature and people and delivering quality wood products to market. As the largest forest manager in Ireland, Coillte has been living this challenge every day. Through technology, Coillte has been planting innovative solutions to help the company manage its forests effectively and sustainably.\n",
            "Coillte, a semi-state forest company with headquarters in Newtownmountkennedy County Wicklow, manages 440,000 hectares of lands––nearly 7 percent of the total land area of Ireland––and dedicates 20 percent of its holdings primarily for biodiversity. With a vision to manage the State forests on behalf of the people of Ireland and to deliver the multiple benefits from its forests, Coillte has put technology, security and sustainability at its core. One key development is the launch of its Smart Timber Security System (STSS) designed to innovate its supply chain to connect people and its forests in real time, ensuring the right information and the right products are delivered to the right person every time.\n",
            "Upgraded in 2021, the STSS combines the WSX targeted forest logistics tool from Trimble Forestry with a telematics solution from ORBCOMM. Designed to meet Coillte’s sustainable stock management needs as well as the needs of its customers, the customized haulage, logistics and telematics (HLT) solution enables Coillte to better manage all branches of its supply chain––from customer orders, planning, harvesting, loading, transporting and delivery. Most importantly, the satellite-based system connects Coillte and 400 haulage trucks in real time, enabling the company to manage its log supply and distribution with improved visibility, flexibility, control, interactivity and security.\n",
            "Once supply chain coordinators collaborate with the harvesting function and the Galway-based Trimble Forestry team to generate timber orders, hauliers use the WSX mobile app to download their electronic timber removal permit (TRP) which details the precise job order––logs to collect, amount to collect, and from which forest. When the driver arrives at the designated section of geofenced forest, an alert is sent to the WSX, prompting the tool to confirm if the driver is in the right place. Validated, the driver proceeds to loading where they can ensure they’re collecting the exact species, length and volume of logs ordered. The driver then proceeds to delivery. The WSX system is monitoring this forest floor-to-mill activity in real time, ensuring that harvesters know what and how much is moving from their lots, hauliers know they have fulfilled the order, and sawmills know what and how much is en route to their mill. With more confidence in the haulage process and optimized navigation, drivers can reduce rework, fuel use and their carbon footprint.\n",
            "With 95 percent of Ireland’s timber haulage vehicles equipped with this integrated system, the solution’s detailed monitoring not only delivers real-time insight into Coillte’s forest inventory it also provides effective timber traceability and the platform to comply with the country’s plant health regulations––functionality they did not have before.\n",
            "“With this system, we know precisely where any log was cut, its type, who hauled it and where it was delivered, which directly complies with the plant health passport system requirements,” said Des Phelan, Coillte’s distribution manager. “And should any driver be stopped by a forest service inspector, they can generate that passport data in the cab. That’s just one of the many benefits we get from a technology driven supply chain system that improves our efficiency, traceability, stock management and sustainability.”\n",
            "The forest to customer traceability that the WSX system provides also gives Coillte a proactive capability to protect trees from harmful pests and disease. Because it can trace its inventory down to the individual tree species, the company has the accurate knowledge to identify any forest areas that are vulnerable and the responsiveness to rapidly close off specific sections if an outbreak occurs.\n",
            "Ensuring Coillte’s forest products are continuously available from thousands of different harvesting sites requires complex and layered management. Having technology allows Trimble’s support team to see the trees and the forest and can help ensure Ireland’s sustainable resource will endure for generations to come.\n",

The design was agreed upon in the early summer of 2017 and was displayed at the Trimble Small Business Vendor Show in August.

            "One such example of how SketchUp and Omniverse can be used in the future is for urban planning projects. At GTC 2024, Houseal Lavigne presented “Revolutionizing Urban Planning: Omniverse and OpenUSD for City Scale Digital Twins” to showcase their advanced visualization workflow. With SketchUp’s new import and export functionality for USDZ, users have a more seamless transition between SketchUp and Omniverse. The new export options are game-changers for designers at Houseal Lavigne, who have for the first time ever, taken an entire city modeled in SketchUp into Omniverse Creator. Read more about their project here.\n",
            "Another example where the benefits of advanced visualization workflows can be realized is in the public sector. An application solution like the urban planning example above could also be a game changer for owners and operators globally, such as the U.S. State Departments of Transportation. “These organizations have both large projects and large groups of assets that generate enormous amounts of data that is not easy to consume via traditional methods. Trimble has seen public sector owners in the Nordics and EU leverage visualizations to make data concepts like 3D BIM accessible to all users within an owner organization,” said Cyndee Hoagland, senior vice president for Trimble’s Owner and Public Sector. “Humans inherently experience their world in 3D, for owners this is the next step in extending BIM beyond the project and taking advantage of asset lifecycle management.

            "Sweden’s transport infrastructure is bursting at the seams. Its roads and railways are clogged and an estimated 16 percent population growth by 2040 is forecast to bring about a 30 percent increase in passenger transport. In addition, the movement of goods is expected to grow by 50 percent, further straining its aged infrastructure. Bearing the initial brunt of this high volume will be the railways.\n",
            "To meet this demand as well as climate objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045, the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) committed to building the country’s first-ever high-speed railway (HSR). Connecting Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö, the 440-kilometer dual-rail network will support trains at speeds of 250-320 kilometers per hour, cutting by half today’s journey times between Stockholm and Malmö and increasing sustainable travel and freeing more space for freight transport on the existing railway.\n",
            "Choosing where to place the new tracks and stations is the job of Atkins Sweden, a global design and engineering consultancy that is a recognized leader in sustainable business practices.\n",
            "Since 2019, it has been conducting a feasibility study for the East Link Project (ELP), the first 160-km section of the HSR that runs from Järna, south of Stockholm to Linköping. Atkins’ role is to develop design alternatives for track routes and station locations in Linköping based on a host of factors such as safety, geometry, costs, and environmental impacts.\n",
            "Historically, feasibility studies required teams to pore over maps and both manually draw potential alignments and calculate costs. For the ELP, Atkins streamlined that process through the expertise of Mark Lidback, a railway designer, and one piece of software—Trimble® Quantm™, an alignment planning solution that integrates engineering, environmental, social and economic factors into a simultaneous analysis of alternatives.\n",
            "“Quantm not only automates the laborious and costly manual feasibility process, it provides a more in-depth analysis with high precision in a fraction of the time,” said Lidback. “I can input my start and end points, along with factors to consider such as cost and geometric parameters, protected nature areas, military zones, and CO2 emissions, and it will automatically generate optimal alignments, corridors and estimated costs. I can then compare and test the different scenarios to determine the best option. It’s a totally different game.”\n",
            "A significant challenge for Atkins is designing an optimal connection from one station to the next.  Where the station is placed In Linköping will influence different exit and entrance routes to the next station. All the possible entrance/exit points need to be assessed for each station and equally compared. With Quantm, Lidback can quickly determine possible corridors and line alignments, identify if those options will require bridges or tunnels, and calculate construction costs. He can also quickly change any analysis parameters and run new tests and comparisons—a valuable advantage given the fluidity of the project scope and tight deadlines.\n",
            "“I’ve generated about 250 different scenarios for the project so far,” said Lidback. “And the corridors I’ve produced are also optimized based on that CO2 factor. There’s no way I could’ve produced that magnitude of analysis myself without Quantm.”\n",
            "As the STA speeds toward the end of its design consultation phase in 2022, Atkins will be on board to help them determine the most favorable and sustainable route from point A to B.\n",

            "Nearly 75 percent of the UK’s 24 million hectares of land is farmed for food production. A lifeblood providing nourishment and livelihoods, the agriculture industry employs about 472,000 people and feeds millions.\n",
            "Farmers have always been challenged to combine traditional agronomic techniques with the best precision technology and plant science to grow their crops—and farms—organically and sustainably.\n",
            "UK-based PX Farms is one agribusiness using precision agriculture and geospatial solutions. Run by fourth-generation farmer James Peck, PX Farms has been farming its 4,850 hectares (12,000 acres) since it was established in 2003—a business that grew from the Pecks family-owned businesses dating back to 1896.\n",
            "Capitalizing on its own successes with advanced farm-management technologies, the company provides agricultural services and tailored solutions to help establish, operate, grow and improve farm businesses.\n",
            "“Millions of people depend on what we do, so it’s crucial that we take care of the environment,” said Peck. “We use the latest technology and innovative farming techniques to maximize yields, reduce input costs and minimize environmental impacts.”\n",
            "Innovation is indeed at the company’s core. PX Farms was one of the first in the UK to use Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF), an agriculture approach that involves using the same vehicle tracks consistently across all machinery. With CTF they’ve reduced soil compaction and damage to their land by 73 percent, overall fuel costs by 13 percent, and input expenses by 6 percent.\n",
            "Supporting this system are hardware and software solutions from Trimble that connect Peck’s fields and farm specialists and give them the tools to turn farm data into profitable decisions in real time.\n",
            "With Trimble® Ag Software (formerly FarmWorks), PX Farms can integrate, simplify, and streamline disparate data streams to manage its entire farm operation with a few clicks. Most importantly, they have the tools to capture and integrate important operational data and analyze it to get the most value from every hectare.\n",
            "To maximize yield and reduce fuel cost, every single field is mapped with Trimble RTK technology and set up for machines with a 11.9 meter axel width and a 1.8 meter internal track spacing, ensuring exact wheel placement. Connected to guidance and mapping features of the Trimble FmX precision agriculture display, Peck can ensure the machinery operates within a tolerance of 2 centimeters.\n",
            "The Trimble FmX® and TMX™ systems also automate crop spraying. Peck can map nutrients per hectare and program the data into the spreader to meet that year’s offtake. He can also minimize phosphate amounts being sprayed while maximizing the phosphates each plant gets.\n",
            "PX Farms’ is reducing inputs by 3-5 percent and decreasing pollution with its precision drill and sprayer. Using RTK positioning for sectional control, they can target the right amount of product to the right place in their field. Utilizing a boom spreader also allows the company to improve distribution accuracy and make the most of fertilizer as a critical crop input. Coupled with the certainty and precision provided by Trimble technology, and its sustainable farming practices, PX Farms is reaping the rewards of what it sows.\n",

La Partie réceptrice prend toutes les mesures raisonnables afin d’éviter la divulgation, la diffusion ou l’utilisation non autorisée des Informations confidentielles de la Partie émettrice, ce qui implique au minimum les mêmes mesures de protection que celles appliquées à ses propres Informations confidentielles de nature semblable. La Partie réceptrice limite la détention, la connaissance et l’utilisation des Informations confidentielles à ses employés, ses contractants, ses conseillers juridiques et financiers qui (i) ont besoin de connaître ces Informations confidentielles du fait de la relation commerciale existant entre les parties et (ii) ont signé des accords écrits de non divulgation les obligeant à protéger les Informations confidentielles.\n",

Nenhuma renúncia, modificação ou inclusão a estes Termos, ou qualquer cessão dos seus direitos ou obrigações ao amparo dos mesmos é válida ou vinculante para nós, a menos que seja feita por escrito e assinada por um representante autorizado. Estes Termos e outros contratos aplicáveis que você celebra com a Trimble constituem o acordo integral entre você e a Trimble para a sua aquisição e utilização de Produtos e Software. Cada pedido aceito será interpretado como um único conjunto de Termos, independentemente dos outros pedidos. 1.         Definições. \"Produtos\" significa os produtos de hardware fornecidos no presente instrumento. \"Software\" significa qualquer software, biblioteca, utilitário, ferramenta ou outro código de computador ou programa, na forma de objeto (binário) ou código-fonte, e a documentação relacionada fornecidos pela Trimble a você.

Os pedidos são aceitos como válidos e vinculantes somente quando confirmados por nós por escrito.

            "10. Inspection and Acceptance. Each Item is subject to inspection and test by Buyer (or its authorized contract manufacturer) prior to acceptance to verify conformance to specifications and material and workmanship requirements.  Buyer has the right to reject or require correction of any Items that do not conform to the requirements of this PO, which Items shall be promptly replaced or corrected by Seller at its sole expense.  The making of payment will not prejudice Buyer’s right of rejection. Upon reasonable notice and at mutually agreeable times, Seller shall permit Buyer to conduct source inspections and/or testing on Seller’s premises, and Seller shall provide Buyer’s inspectors with reasonable access to facilities and assistance at no additional charge. Source inspections may include participation by Buyer’s customers for the Items.\n",

Disclaimer of Warranties. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TRIMBLE TOOLKIT, DOCUMENTATION, DEVELOPER PORTAL, AND ANY FEATURES OF THE FOREGOING (“TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING”) IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND TRIMBLE AND ITS THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. TRIMBLE MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE RELATED TO AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, PERFORMANCE, OR QUALITY OF THE TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING, THAT TRIMBLE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER ANY ELEMENT OF THE TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING, OR THAT ACCESS TO OR USE OF ANY TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR MEET DEVELOPER’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, ACHIEVE INTENDED RESULTS, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ALL SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, SYSTEMS OR SERVICES, OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED. You may have other statutory rights, in which case the disclaimers above will apply to the full extent permitted by law.14. Limitations of Liability. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TRIMBLE  OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS (A) FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY IN ADVANCE, OR (B) IN ANY EVENT, FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES EXCEEDING THE GREATER OF ONE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ($1,000) OR THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO TRIMBLE UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, TRIMBLE HAS NO WARRANTY, INDEMNIFICATION, OR OTHER OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR DEVELOPER APPLICATIONS OR THEIR COMBINATION, INTERACTION, OR USE WITH ANY ELEMENT OF THE TRIMBLE DEVELOPER OFFERING, END USER DATA, OR TRIMBLE SOLUTION. You acknowledge and agree that this Section 14 (Limitation of Liability) reflects a reasonable allocation of risk and will apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and that Trimble would not enter into the Terms without these liability limitations. This Section 14 (Limitation of Liability) will survive notwithstanding any limited remedy’s failure of essential purpose.15. Trimble Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any non-public elements of the Trimble Toolkit, Documentation, and any other information disclosed by Trimble that is marked as confidential or proprietary or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential or proprietary from the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public; (b) was known to you before its disclosure by Trimble; or (c) is received by you from a third party, in each case without breach of an obligation owed to Trimble or anyone else. You will (i) maintain Confidential Information in confidence (using at least the same measures as for your own confidential information, and no less than reasonable care) and not divulge it to any third party and (ii) only use Confidential Information to fulfill your obligations under the Terms. If you are compelled by Law to disclose Confidential Information, you must provide Trimble with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance if Trimble wishes to contest the disclosure. If you breach or threaten to breach this Section 15 (Trimble Confidential Information), it could cause substantial harm for which damages are inadequate and Trimble will have the right to seek injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.16. Independent Development; Information You Provide Not Confidential. Trimble develops a variety of products and services and works with many other developers and partners, and either Trimble or these third parties could in the future develop (or already have developed) products, services, concepts, or features similar to your Developer Application. Nothing limits Trimble’s right to do so, though this Section itself does not grant Trimble any license under your intellectual property rights. Unless separately set forth in another agreement, Trimble has no confidentiality obligations for information you submit to Trimble.17. Usage Data. In addition to Trimble’s other rights, Trimble may collect certain data and information regarding your access to or use of the Trimble Toolkit and Developer Portal, including data about your data pulls or requests, your Developer Applications, and the End User accounts that you access (collectively, “Usage Data”). We may use and exploit Usage Data for any purpose in connection with operating, improving, and supporting the Trimble Toolkit and the operation of our business.18. Open Source Software. Certain code in the Trimble Toolkit may be licensed under or include components subject to “open source” software terms (“OSS”), as listed in the Documentation, Supplemental Developer Terms, or as otherwise made available by Trimble upon request. The OSS licenses may grant you additional rights to the OSS code itself and allow you to use the OSS outside of our Trimble Toolkit. To be clear, though, when you use the OSS as part of the Trimble Toolkit, you must comply with the Terms. 19. Changes to Terms. Trimble may modify the Terms from time to time. Trimble will use reasonable efforts to notify you of modifications as provided in Section 20 (Notices). You may be required to click through the modified Terms to show your acceptance and in any event your continued access or use of the Trimble Toolkit after the notification of modification constitutes your acceptance to the modifications. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, your sole remedy is to terminate your access and use of the Trimble Toolkit as described in Section 12 (Term; Termination and Suspension). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if you have entered into a mutually executed agreement with Trimble, then any amendments require the written consent of both parties, and (B) if you have paid a fee and have electronically accepted the Terms, then the new Terms will take effect upon renewal; provided, however, in any instance of (A) or (B), for any modifications required for compliance with Laws, such modifications will take effect 30 days after they are provided to you. 20. Notices. Except as set out in these Term, any notice or consent under the Terms must be in writing and will be deemed given: (a) upon receipt if by personal delivery, (b) upon receipt if by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested), or (c) one day after dispatch if by an internationally reputable commercial overnight delivery service. If to Trimble, notice must be provided to the address in Section 22(a)(Trimble Entity) below, with a copy to Trimble Inc., Attn: General Counsel – Important Notice, 935 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA. If to Developer, Trimble may provide notice to the address Developer provided at registration, at execution of a written agreement, or otherwise in writing. Either party may update its address with notice to the other party. Trimble may also send general and operational notices to Developer by email or through the Developer Portal.21. Export Restrictions. Developer acknowledges that the Trimble Toolkit is subject to export restrictions by the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Developer will not, and will not allow any third party to, remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of Trimble Toolkit or any direct product thereof: (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, Laws of any United States or foreign agency or authority. Developer warrants that it is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. The Trimble Toolkit is further restricted from being used for the design or development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology, or for terrorist activity, without the prior permission of the United States government. Developer will defend, indemnify, and hold Trimble harmless against any liability (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of Developer’s failure to comply with the terms of this provision. Developer’s obligations under this paragraph will survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.22. Trimble Entity; Governing Law and Venue. A. Trimble Entity.

The Terms will be governed exclusively by, and construed and enforced exclusively in accordance with, the laws of the jurisdiction set forth in the table above as the Governing Law based on Developer’s location provided to Trimble without regard to or application of conflicts of law provisions and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

General. The Terms are the parties’ entire agreement and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements relating to its subject matter. The Terms are a separate agreement from, and do not amend or modify, the Trimble Solution End User Terms. Except as set forth in Section 19 (Changes to Terms), all amendments or modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties. The words “including” and similar terms are to be construed without limitation. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver and all waivers must be in writing. If any provision is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so the rest of the Terms remain in effect. Developer may not assign, transfer, or delegate any right or obligations under the Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, and any non-permitted assignment is void. Trimble may assign the Terms and its rights and obligations to any of its affiliates or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities to which the Terms relate. The parties are independent contractors and the Terms do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Trimble may engage the services of subcontractors or agents in connection making the Trimble Toolkit available to you. Trimble will not be liable to Developer for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Terms if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that are beyond its reasonable control. The Trimble Toolkit and Trimble Solution are commercial computer software. If the user or licensee of such technology is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of such technology, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by the Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Trimble Toolkit and Trimble Solution were developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. If the parties enter into an executed written agreement, such agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be considered an original and all of which when taken together will constitute a single fully-signed original.  Facsimile and other electronic means of signatures are binding. The official language of the Terms is English.  For purposes of interpretation, or in the event of a conflict between English and versions of the Terms in any other language, the English language version shall be controlling.24. Australia-Specific Terms. For Developer who are located in Australia, the following provisions apply:A. “Australian Consumer Law” means the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and “Non-excludable Condition” means certain consumer guarantees, warranties, rights, or remedies under the Australian Consumer Law that cannot be limited, excluded, restricted, or modified, and to which Developer may be entitled. For purposes of the following limitation of liability statement, the parties intend for the following: “service” means a Trimble Solution that is a cloud-based offering and “goods” means Trimble Toolkit and a Trimble Solution that is a software application. B. To the extent permitted by law, Trimble’s liability in relation to breach of any such Non-excludable Condition shall be limited as follows (and in which “our” or “us” means Trimble, and “you” means Developer):\n",
            "a) in the case of the goods, to repairing or replacing the goods, supplying equivalent goods, or paying the costs of repairing or replacing the goods or acquiring equivalent goods; and\n",
